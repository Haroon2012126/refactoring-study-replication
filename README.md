# Replication Package – Empirical Study on Refactorings in Open-Source Projects

### Overview
This repository provides the replication package for our empirical study on how developers perform refactorings in practice across three open-source systems: **Apache Ant**, **Apache JMeter**, and **JFreeChart**.  
The dataset combines automated refactoring detection results from *RefactoringMiner* with manually validated commit-level information.
